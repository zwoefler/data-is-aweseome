# Data is Awesome
Answering questions with opinionated data stories and visuals in small self contained projects.

Focus on making (at least you) your audience understand the subject and make connections obvious.

Read more about the [❓️Why](docs/Why.md)?
⚠️Lots of text!


## 📏 Rules
- Datasources must be publicly available
- No paywalls, or you got a higher ladder ;)
- Script(s) lead from data download to final JSON-file (data)
- Datafolder stores data in a data/ directory
- Data sources have a README explaining the context

## ToDos
- [ ] Add CONTRIBUTING.md + rules
- [ ] Add LICENSE
- [ ] Refine Mission statement
- [ ] Script to get started with new project easily!
- [ ] Pipeline to check if everything is there (docs, scripts, etc.)
- [ ] Include WHY section in docs/README
- [ ] External Data storage - not all in the Git repo
- [ ] Docs - for (sub)project with Tutorial, How-To, requirements
- [ ] Add Docker containers per project to run data visuals
- [ ] Every project with it's own visualization?

##  Data
All Data has a README answering the following questions:
- WHERE is the data valid? (City, Country, Continent, Celestial Body)
- WHEN is the data valid? (Far gone time period, valid today + estimates in the future?
- WHO ordered/comissioned/gathered the data?
- HOW was the data gathered? (Survey (participants), counting hand vs. technical)
- WHAT is the public source? A link or links with an explanation should the data be aggreageted.

## Technicals
Each separate project is it's own closed environment using `Python3.8` or higher to generate or scrape data.
The `requirements.txt` holds all necessary requirements.
Use a `python3-venv` to separate your system Python3 from the packages you need!

The data format is JSON!


## Why JSON?
- Easy to manage
- Don't know beforehand what data is available
- Don't want to use a database... yet

- Documentation and textbased stuff in `Markdown`
- The project stays detangled from GitHub!
- Use Emojis and don't take yourself to seriously 😉
